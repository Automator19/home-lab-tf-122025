Why terragrunt use dynamoDB for backend ?
- DynamoDB is used for state locking. It prevents two people (or ci jobs) from changing the same Terraform state at a time. 
- Quick Break down 
    - S3 --> Stores Terraform State file
    - DynamoDB --> Stores a tiny lock record to make sure only one apply/plan runs at once.
    - terragrunt --> Automatically creates/uses the the DynamoDB table so state locking is safe.

What are the helper files ? 
- Locations
    - live/dev/env.hcl
    - live/prod/env.hcl
    - live/dev/us-east-1/region.hcl
    - live/prod/us-east-2/region.hcl

This file tells terragrunt "Where am I?" So it can fill in the variables in the /live/terragrunt.hcl code.
